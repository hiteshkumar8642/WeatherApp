# Example Usage
Fetch Weather Data
The system fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API at a configurable interval. To test the functionality, ensure the scheduler is running (as configured in the tasks.py).

Daily Summary
To get the daily weather summary for a city, use the Django shell or your applicationâ€™s interface:
```bash
from weather.models import City, WeatherData
from django.utils import timezone
from datetime import datetime

city = City.objects.create(name='Delhi')
WeatherData.objects.create(
    city=city,
    main='Clear',
    temp=30.0,
    feels_like=32.0,
    dt=timezone.make_aware(datetime.combine(timezone.now().date(), datetime.min.time()))
)
WeatherData.objects.create(
    city=city,
    main='Clear',
    temp=35.0,
    feels_like=37.0,
    dt=timezone.make_aware(datetime.combine(timezone.now().date(), datetime.max.time()))
)
summary = WeatherData.daily_summary(city)
print(summary)

```

# Alerts
Set up and configure alert thresholds based on your requirements. The system will notify you if the conditions exceed the configured thresholds.
